  "description": "Crispy chicken skin, tender meat, and rich, tomatoey sauce form a winning trifecta of delicious in this one-pot braise. We spoon it over rice and peas to soak up every last drop of goodness, and serve a tangy arugula salad alongside for a vibrant boost of flavor and color. Dinner is served! Cook, relax, and enjoy!",
